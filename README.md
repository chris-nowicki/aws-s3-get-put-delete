## AWS S3 BUCKET get/pull/delete for images
This is a quick project I put together to learn how to use Amazon S3 Buckets to store images for my applications.

## Overview
The goal of the project was to successfully create an app that had the following requirements:

- User Login/Registration
- Add Profile Photo
  - Photos are stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket
  - Links to the photos are stored in the user document in MongoDB
- Delete Profile Photo from both AWS S3 and MongoDB
- Retrieve profile photo on user login
